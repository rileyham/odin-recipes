    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
             Add mushrooms, season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally,
              until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes
               Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring, 
               until meat is browned and crumbly, and onions turn soft 
               and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with black pepper
                and cayenne.</li>
        <li>Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute.
             Pour in vodka and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds.
              Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. Cook,
               stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles.
             Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes.
              Uncover and stir thoroughly. 
              Cover again and cook until noodles are just tender, 
              about 3 minutes. (See Cook's Note.)</li>
        <li>Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low,
             and stir in sour cream. Serve immediately with additional 
             sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.</li>
